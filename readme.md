This is an automation code for Genshin Impact just for testing I did in python in 2022, there is not much to do in it.

There are attempts with the win32 api but there was some type of protection going on (in 2022 I think?), I don't know...

However, I recommend checking out the work of GIA (原神小助手 Genshin Impact Assistant) that's where I got inspiration

GIA -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZieBDx6Go4A v0.2.0 demo video.

I didn't have time to finish the full project, sorry 😢
